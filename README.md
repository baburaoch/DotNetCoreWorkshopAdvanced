# Dotnet Core Workshop

This repository is a workshop created to demonstrate dotnet core applications the [steeltoe](https://steeltoe.io/) microservices library and [Tanzu Application Service (TAS)](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-service).  In completing this workshop one can expect to go from zero to a complete sample application showing off some of Steeltoe's main features along with their respective Tanzu Application Service integrations.  The best effort was made to detail and explain each and every step but some familiarity with .NET, .NET Core and Tanzu Application Service would be helpful in completing these exercises.
